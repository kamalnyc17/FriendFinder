# Friend Finder App

The idea of this website is to simulate a dating app but to use it to find friends instead.

Users need to answer a survey of 10 questions. The answers are scored between 1-5. Once an user submits the survey, the script will match it
with the existing members and select a friend who is the best match. It will prompt the user with the name and picture of the best match.
